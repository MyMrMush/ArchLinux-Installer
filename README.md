# ArchLinux-Installer
This project is supposed to provide all possible tools to make an ArchLinux installation as straight forward as possible.

This guide covers both UEFI and Legacy/BIOS installation variants. It will focus on encrypted btrfs filesystem, but briefly explain other options in the guide files.

# Disclaimer
As ArchLinux is quickly changing and from time to time recommended steps during installation change, this project may not always be up to date. Handle with care!
